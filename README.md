### Installation
1. Save the script as `nag` somewhere in your path (eg `~/bin`)
2. `chmod a+x ~/bin/nag`

Or clone this repo and symlink the file to somewhere in your path.

NB: You probably shouldn't use this script: I don't know what I'm doing (see below).

### Usage

Run `nag` on its own to see the oldest item on your todo list. Use nag with these arguments to manage your list:

* a - add an item to your list
* c - clear your list
* d [n] - remove item [n] from your list
* ls - show the contents of your list

### Why?

I know the world doesn't need yet another CLI todo list thingy, but I just finished _[Learning Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/index)_ and wanted to try to make something.
